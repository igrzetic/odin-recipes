<h1>Juicy Burger</h1>
<p>No more dry, lackluster hamburgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit 
    anyone's taste. If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties 
    that hold their shape.
</p>

<p>
    This aptly named hamburger recipe uses evaporated milk, eggs, and bread crumbs to create incredibly juicy 
    and flavorful hamburger patties that will rival your favorite burger joint.
</p>

<h2>How to Make Hamburger Patties</h2>
<p>
    To make hamburger patties, just mix the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, evaporated milk, and spices and 
    seasonings in a bowl using your hands.
</p>

<h3>How to Season Hamburgers</h3>
<p>
    The best way to season hamburger patties depends on personal taste. This top-rated recipe is 
    seasoned with Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, and garlic. But you can get creative with 
    what's in your spice cabinet — they're your burgers, after all.
</p>

<h2>How to Grill Hamburgers</h2>
<p>
    It couldn't be easier to <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-grill-the-best-burger/">grill hamburger patties</a>! You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief 
    overview of what you can expect:
</p>

<p>
    Prepare the grill grate by cleaning it and brushing it lightly with oil. Heat a 
    charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat, then grill the patties on each side (the length of time 
    depends on the level of doneness you're after). If you're making cheeseburgers, add a slice of cheese 
    about a minute before the burger is finished.
</p>

<h3>What Temperature Is a Hamburger Done?</h3>
<p>
    Hamburger patties are done when a food thermometer inserted into the center reaches 160 degrees F.
</p>

<h3>How Long to Grill Hamburgers</h3>
<p>
    The only way to ensure that illness-causing bacteria has been destroyed is to make sure a food thermometer 
    inserted into the center of the meat reaches 160 degrees F.
</p>
<p>
    This recipe calls for about 4-5 minutes of grilling time on each side — that should get you into the 
    safe-zone (you can use a thermometer to make sure).
</p>
<p>
    Rare and medium-rare burgers will be ready more quickly, but they are a bit riskier when it comes to 
    foodborne illness.

<h2>How to Store Hamburger Patties</h2>
<p>
    Let hamburger patties cool, then store in an airtight container for up to three days in the fridge. 
    Reheat in the oven or microwave.
</p>

<h2>Can You Freeze Hamburger Patties?</h2>
<p>
    Absolutely! You can freeze both cooked and uncooked hamburger patties.
</p>
<p>
    To freeze cooked burger patties: Wrap each patty individually in aluminum foil. Don't wrap them together, 
    as they're likely to stick. Place wrapped patties in a freezer-safe bag labeled with the date. Freeze for 
    up to three months.
</p>
<p>
    To freeze uncooked burger patties: Arrange uncooked patties in a single layer on a baking sheet and cover 
    tightly with storage wrap. Freeze for at least a few hours or up to overnight. When the burgers are frozen, 
    wrap them individually in foil. Place wrapped patties in a freezer-safe bag labeled with the date. Freeze for 
    up to three months.
</p>
<p>
    Thaw frozen burgers in the fridge.
